### Virtual/Augmented/Mixed Reality headsets

**VR** - A head-mounted display that shows you immersive, 3D, and fully computer generated environment. The generated world may be created using real world content (e.g. images, synthetic content[^3]),but it bears no relation to the user's environment, hence virtual.

**AR** - A head-mounted display that lets you see your real surroundings augmented by a computer (e.g. with superimposed images, sound, position data). An example of AR would be an app that shows you how you look like with a new pair of glasses.

**MR** - Similar to AR but allows interaction between the actual world and the computer generated content, e.g. [Microsoft HoloLens](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens).
