## General purpose vs dedicated computing devices

- Multi-user computers
  - Mainframes
    - Large multitask machines
  - Minicomputers
    - Small multitask machines
  - Supercomputers
    - Machines focused on a single task
    - Used for massive number crunching
      - Geothermal data, CGI movie effects, census
- Dedicated computers
  - Desktops
  - Laptops/portable

---

## Operating systems

- Basis for user interaction
- Enable apps to run
- Designed for specific hardware
  - Windows runs on IBM/Intel
  - Apple runs on Macintosh
- GUI vs CLI
- ~~Skipping Windows, Apple, Linux OSs cause self-explanatory~~
- ChromeOS by Google
  - Linux variant
  - Designed for thin clients
    - Minimal computers designed for internet only
    - Has very little storage, most storage is in the cloud

---

## Mobile computing devices

- Smartphones
  - iOS
  - Android
  - BlackBerry (mostly dead)
    - Distinct feature was it's hardware keyboard
  - Windows Phones (so very dead)
- Tablets
  - Mostly you can't call or text from a tabled
    - Exception: phablets
  - iOS
  - Android
- Specialty devices
  - Created for specific task
    - Reading, calculating, maps

---

## Networks

- Network is two or more computers communicating
- To connect computers you need a **switch**
  - e.g. **router**, that often acts as wireless access point (WAP)
  - Physically connects computers with cables or cords
  - Allows computers to communicate with other networks outside the current one
  - Data can be shared via phone line, DSL connection, cable TV lines, network cables, etc.

---

- Local area network (LAN)
  - Two or more computers connected in a single location (e.g. school, office, home)
- Wide area network (WAN)
  - Two or more LANs connected together

    ```[ascii]
            [WAN]                          [LAN]


              [PC]                           [PC]
              |                              |
    [PC]----[Switch]----[PC]       [PC]----[Switch]----[PC]
              |
            [Router]
              |
    [PC]----[Switch]----[PC]
              |
              [PC]
    ```

- Servers
  - Machines that fulfill specific roles on computer network
    - e.g. file, app, mail, print server
- Clients
  - Machine that receives services
- Recourse sharing
  - Allows you to share resources instead of having multiple
    - e.g. connect all computers to one printer

---

## Remotely accessed computer systems

- Client access servers
- Mobile apps
  - Most are server connected but can be standalone
- Streaming media
- Web apps

---

## Cloud computing

- Data hosted online
- Subscription software 
  - Often cheaper than buying a full version
  - Automated updates
- Minimizes the need to download locally

---

## Virtualization

- Running a system inside of another system
  - VMs
- Used A LOT in networking
- Can save companies money on hardware and maintenance
- Hypervisors
  : virtualization software
  - Type 1
    - Doesn't require OS
    - Shares recourses among virtual computers
    - Can be more efficient and stable than Type 2
  - Type 2
    - Requires an OS
    - You run it as an app
      - Can slow down your system cause there's a lot of other stuff running

---

## Specialized computer systems

- Do one specific task
  - Point-of-sale terminals (POS)
    - Contain input, memory, minimal processing power
  - ATMs
    - Uses multi-factor authentication
  - GPS
    - Outdated devices that determine your position based on satellites
    - Wherever you are, the GPS unit has access to at least 4 satellites and can determine your position (within a few feet) based on the speed of light
  - Voice over IP (VoIP)
    - Teleconference
      - Simulates in-person meeting environment
      - Uses life-size participant displays
      - High-fidelity, spatial audio
      - Specific room setup and equipment required
      - Higher technology and setup costs
      - May have compatibility issues with different providers
    - Teleconferencing
      - Used for various meeting types
      - Shows participants in a standard video window
      - Compatible with computers and phones
      - User-friendly and easy to set up
      - More affordable
      - Better interoperability across platforms
